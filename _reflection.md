Setting up the Git repository and Django environment was not as simple as I expected, and the whole process really tested both my skills and patience. One of the first challenges I faced was when I tried to activate my virtual environment. 

The command (.venv\scripts\activate) did not work, and I could not move forward
with my setup. After doing some research online, I found out that the issue was related to PowerShell's execution policy. By running the command Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process, I was able to temporarily allow scripts for that session. This solution finally let me activate the environment using (.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1). The experience taught me the value of reading error messages carefully and searching for reliable solutions instead of giving up quickly.

Another obstacle appeared when I attempted to check the Django version. Using the command python -m Django - version did not give the expected result. After some trial and error, I discovered that replacing python with py (py -m Django --version) worked properly. These issues may seem small, but they reminded me of the importance of flexibility, attention to detail, and adapting commands depending on the environment.

Overall, I realized that problem-solving and persistence are key when working with development tools like Git and Django.
